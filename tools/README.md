Requirements
============

openpilot tools and the following setup steps are developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04, MacOS 10.14.2 and, Python 3.8.2.

Setup
============
1. Run `ubuntu_setup.sh` or `mac_setup.sh`, and make sure that everything completed correctly

2. Compile openpilot by running ```scons``` in the openpilot directory
   or alternatively run ```./openpilot_build.sh``` (uses a pre-configured docker container)

3. Try out some tools!


Tool examples
============


Replay driving data
-------------

**Hardware needed**: none

`unlogger.py` replays data collected with [dashcam](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/dashcam) or [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot).

Unlogger with remote data:

```
# Log in via browser
python lib/auth.py

# Start unlogger
python replay/unlogger.py <route-name>
#Example:
#python replay/unlogger.py '3533c53bb29502d1|2019-12-10--01-13-27'

# In another terminal you can run a debug visualizer:
python replay/ui.py   # Define the environmental variable HORIZONTAL is the ui layout is too tall
```

Unlogger with local data downloaded from device or https://my.comma.ai:

```
python replay/unlogger.py <route-name> <path-to-data-directory>

#Example:

#python replay/unlogger.py '99c94dc769b5d96e|2018-11-14--13-31-42' /home/batman/unlogger_data

#Within /home/batman/unlogger_data:
#  99c94dc769b5d96e|2018-11-14--13-31-42--0--fcamera.hevc
#  99c94dc769b5d96e|2018-11-14--13-31-42--0--rlog.bz2
#  ...
```

LogReader with remote data

```python
from tools.lib.logreader import LogReader
from tools.lib.route import Route
route = Route('3533c53bb29502d1|2019-12-10--01-13-27')
log_paths = route.log_paths()
events_seg0 = list(LogReader(log_paths[0]))
print(len(events_seg0), 'events logged in first segment')
```

Debug car controls
-------------

**Hardware needed**: [panda](panda.comma.ai), [giraffe](https://comma.ai/shop/products/giraffe/), joystick

Use the panda's OBD-II port to connect with your car and a usb cable to connect the panda to your pc.
Also, connect a joystick to your pc.

`joystickd.py` runs a deamon that reads inputs from a joystick and publishes them over zmq.
`boardd` sends the CAN messages from your pc to the panda.
`debug_controls` is a mocked version of `controlsd.py` and uses input from a joystick to send controls to your car.

Make sure the conditions are met in the panda to allow controls (e.g. cruise control engaged). You can also make a modification to the panda code to always allow controls.

Usage:
```
python carcontrols/joystickd.py

# In another terminal:
BASEDIR=$(pwd) selfdrive/boardd/boardd

# In another terminal:
python carcontrols/debug_controls.py

```

Stream replayed CAN messages to EON
-------------

**Hardware needed**: 2 x [panda](panda.comma.ai), [debug board](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda-debug-board/), [EON](https://comma.ai/shop/products/eon-gold-dashcam-devkit/).

It is possible to replay CAN messages as they were recorded and forward them to a EON.Â 
Connect 2 pandas to the debug board. A panda connects to the PC, the other panda connects to the EON.

Usage:
```
# With MOCK=1 boardd will read logged can messages from a replay and send them to the panda.
MOCK=1 selfdrive/boardd/tests/boardd_old.py

# In another terminal:
python replay/unlogger.py <route-name> <path-to-data-directory>

```

Welcomed contributions
=============

* Documentation: code comments, better tutorials, etc..
* Support for other platforms other than Ubuntu 20.04.
* Performance improvements: the tools have been developed on high-performance workstations (12+ logical cores with 32+ GB of RAM), so they are not optimized for running efficiently. For example, `ui.py` might not be able to run real-time on most PCs.
* More tools: anything that you think might be helpful to others.
